# CS 260 Notes

Very useful!

## Git/GitHub
I already have plenty of experience with Git/GitHub, but it was fun learning about access tokens and how they can be useful.

- Access tokens are essencially highly secure passwords generated by GitHub to give users access determined by permissions specified upon the generation of the token.

## AWS
My IP elastic address is: 23.21.202.91 I learned when setting up the server there are a few things to worry about:
1. Make sure you are creating an server instance in the region that you want. Mine is `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
2. Select an AMI (server preset to download specific applications). Mine is for cs260 it's `ami-018f3a022e128a6b2`
3. Select an EC2 instance type (specifies the power of the server). Mine is `t3.nano`
4. Save the key as a .pem so that you can shell into it. Don't lose it! Leave it in the project and protect with .gitignore.
5. Security groups are used to block sertain IP addresses. Mine doesn't have any restrictions.
6. Go into Advanced details and change the Credit specification to Unlimited.
7. Website can be accessed with `http://[ip Adress]`
8. Shell into the server using `ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]` exit with `exit`
9. Make the IP address elastic through allocating and associating it with the server. This will change the current IP address, but it will make it impossible to lose it. But you have to deactivate it if the server is terminated.

## Route 53
When I was creating new records for the domain when I was finally approved to get one. I needed to create two type A records, which they are by default. One for the exact url ex: `domain.click`, and one for all subdomains ex: `*.domain.click`.

## Caddy
* Used as a proxy server, a point between the internet and the server
* Provides security through LetsEncrypt, allowing for HTTPS
* Allows us to take advantage of free software that does a good job at taking in web requests
* It can recieve any request on port `:80` because it's the default for all HTTP trafic. But if you want the cirtificates from LetsEncrypt, you need to give it a domain name to wait for. That way it can establish HTTPS

## AWS

My IP address is: 54.81.96.130
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
