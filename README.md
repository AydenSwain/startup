# Green Dumpster Co.

[My Notes](notes.md)

This repository contains the resourses for the development of a full stack website for a small business called Green Dumpster. It's purpose is going to allow users to enter on the site and rent a real large metal dumpster and have it delivered at the time the user discusses with the company. The website, when finished, will look professional, have the capability to make purchases, and converse with a manager in a real time chat to negotiate a delivery time.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### UI

The first image is the look of the home page. It's followed by three other images which represent UI elements that would appear upon completing previous steps. Each new UI element/step would appear above the footer upon the completion of the previous step. This is done for simplicity.
